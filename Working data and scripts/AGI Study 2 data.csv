14,2,10,M,1,3,2,7:54,Alright honestly it's kind of already in its thing um there's a dot in the middle and then lines that connect across like an asterisk again ,n,8:12,0:18,18,1,27,,,,,gestures while describing,n
15,2,8,M,2,3,2,5:01,Hmm so there's two um yeah there's like a parallelogram and it's connected with dots on each corner and then the bottom left dot is the upper right dot on the bottom parallelogram ,n,5:27,0:26,26,2,34,,,,,Points while describing,n
15,2,10,M,3,4,4,6:38,So there's a dot in the middle with okay I already have it made but there's a dot in the middle with um six line segments coming out of it and then dots on each end of the line segments I think it was actually five yeah it was five ,n,6:59,0:21,21,3,51,,,,,Points while describing,n
15,2,19,M,0,2,3,13:43,There's two triangle both obtuse yeah the one on top is more obtuse and then the one on the bottom is less so but there's a dot um halfway between these two dots ,n,14:07,0:24,24,2,34,,,,,"Points while describing at end (""two dots"")",n
16,2,10,M,0,1,0,6:28,So um hm I think I need more dots like that and I think they were triangles like lines together with dots in the end ,n,7:10,0:42,42,1,26,,,,,"Makes pattern without describing; then, describes after finished making",n
16,2,14,M,0,0,0,9:16,Uh so it was a triangle with a dot like with dots in the corners and then there were four extra dots without lines ,n,9:30,0:14,14,2,25,,,,,Points while describing,n
17,3,2,M,0,2,1,1:19,So it looked like a pentagon I think it's a hexagon I'm not sure but it was like this and it had a point on each side ,y,1:55,0:36,36,0,28,,,,,"Makes pattern without describing; then, points while describing after finished making",n
17,3,6,M,3,4,5,5:31,Oh it um this is basically a triangle like fl I guess flipped to the left uh the diamond I think it was a diamond next to it I'm not sure it was two they were side by side but it wasn't together ,n,6:11,0:40,40,3,44,,,,,experimenter had to remind of instruction; gestures while describing,n
17,3,11,M,0,1,1,10:21,So it's like I don’t know what that thing is it's a rhombus I forgot what this shape was called but basically it was like um so basically it's like a little it was like a slanted square um connected to a half of half of a trapezoid ,n,11:04,0:43,43,4,49,,,,,Points while describing,n
17,3,18,M,2,3,2,17:38,So you have a slanted triangle triangle that's slanted with a little triangle at the back with a dot in the middle  with a dot at the at the um the line that's to the right connecting those two ,n,18:16,0:38,38,4,41,,,,,points while describing,n
17,3,20,M,0,2,0,19:34,So you have a triangle on the left side another one on the right side you also have like this narrow one um right side up yeah ,y,20:09,0:35,35,1,28,,,,,gestures while describing,n
18,1,4,M,0,1,3,2:34,So these are connected by a line and then these are all connected and then there's that at the bottom also connected by lines ,n,2:57,0:23,23,0,25,,,,,points while describing,n
19,1,9,M,1,3,1,7:45,There was a rectangle with a dot on each side and then therewas a triangle on top the base of the triangle was facing up and then therewas a at the point of the triangle there was a dot in the middle of the rectangle ,n,8:18,0:33,33,1,46,,,,,Points while describing,n
20,2,1,M,3,5,4,0:13,Okay so there were two distinct shapes that were not connected to each other one was a triangle with each corner having a dot on it and the triangle was irregular I think they call it a scalene triangle and then the other was a diamond that was sort of like a slant and looked kind of like that with a dot at each corner ,n,0:42,0:29,29,0,66,,,,,Points while describing,n
20,2,8,M,0,0,0,6:10,So there were two parallelograms and they had one vertex in common so each parallelogram had a dot at each corner and they had one corner in common so they shared one dot so stemming off of that one dot there was a parallelogram kinda coming like this off the bottom and a second parallelogram coming like this ish off the top so you can see like onethere and one there ,y,6:41,0:31,31,0,72,,,,,Points while describing,n
20,2,10,M,0,2,1,7:54,There was one dot in the middle and sort of like spokes coming off that one dot and each spoke had a dot at the end so it made almost like a star shape like a skeletal star shape but there were six lines coming off of the center dot and each of the six lines had another dot at the end of it ,n,8:17,0:23,23,0,65,,,,,Points while describing,n
20,2,13,M,1,2,2,10:06,So at the top there was a rectangle that had a dot at each corner and then in the middle of the bottom line of the rectangle there was another dot that was top corner of a triangle that also had dots at each corner so it was like there was a triangle and a rectangle stacked on top of it ,n,10:25,0:19,19,0,62,,,,,points while describing,n
22,3,2,M,0,2,2,1:16,okay so this was a hexagon um just the standard shape of one with a dot in the middle that would be a pentagon come on Brandon get with it kinda looked like that with lines connecting these and then just the dot and then just the dot in the middle ,n,2:04,0:48,48,3,52,,,,,"points at the end of description ""lines""",n
22,3,6,M,0,0,3,5:51,alright so there was two triangles that one had a center a dot in the center of it and this guy was a little longer down kinda like that so yeah two triangles uh each with a dot in the corner um and then the first triangle the top left one had a dot in the center or center of the line ,y,6:18,0:27,27,4,63,,,,,points while describing,n
22,3,7,M,0,3,2,6:53,okay this was a trapezoid type shape um with dots on each point lines connecting each dot and then underneath it was a line connected by three dots forming kind of like an umbrella type shape ,n,7:13,0:20,20,1,37,,,,,points while describing,n
22,3,11,M,1,1,3,11:01,okay so we had like a diamond slash rhombus type thing down here and that was connected to a trapezoid type thing down below it so it kinda looks something like that ,n,11:30,0:29,29,1,33,,,,,points while describing,n
22,3,16,M,0,2,1,16:34,okay so we had two triangles um each of them connected with lines so there'd be a line from here to here to here and then from here to here to here um and they formed and they were connected by the center point right here ,y,17:01,0:27,27,3,47,,,,,gestures while describing,n
22,3,18,M,0,2,2,18:30,so here we had like a parallelogram type shape with a triangle beside it so there was a line connecting each point with the triangle right up against it ,n,18:57,0:27,27,0,30,,,,,points while describing,n
22,3,20,M,4,5,4,20:20,so this was three triangles connected by a single point um each of the dots had a line connected to them so it was lines connecting each to the center point with each of the triangles um connecting at this single point right here ,n,21:00,0:40,40,2,45,,,,,points while describing,n
22,3,22,M,2,5,2,22:20,okay so we had a line above um just a line connected by two points and then below that there was two triangles which sh- shared a common point um below it so I said um the line was connected by two points up here and then there was the first triangle and the second one ,y,22:52,0:32,32,5,57,,,,,points while describing,n
25,2,1,M,5,5,1,0:17,it was kind of like a obtuse triangle with a rhombus next to it er not rhombus but like diamond next to it two shapes um and I don't believe that they were connected in any way shape or form wait does it have to use every time okay good I was going to say and I don't believe they were connected in any shape or form,n,0:43,0:26,26,5,67,,,,,"gestures on ""two shapes""",n
25,2,8,M,4,5,3,8:23,what was it it was kind of l-like two s-squished diamonds who are connected together at the hinge point in the middle um a little bit longer a little more squished they seem to be a little bit spaced from each other but connected at this point  not quite as a whole shape but like oh wait I'm not supposed to be gesturing um just two diamonds connected at the middle focal point,n,9:03,0:40,40,6,74,,,,,gestures while describing,n
25,2,10,M,5,4,2,10:56,once again it's a starburst style shape um with a dot in the center connected to a dot point on each end it's a bit more flattened out it's not rounded um yeah can the camera see the table okay yeah but like squished that way it's not like a full round circle or if it was it was then squished but it's that kind of starburst pattern,n,11:48,0:52,52,6,68,,,,,gestures while describing,n
25,2,13,M,1,5,3,15:42, there was a rectangle with a dot in the middle of its line segment Connected to a little triangle yeah it was a rectangular shape with like a dot in the middle of it and that branching off of that was uh a triangular shape and that's it ,n,16:08,0:26,26,4,50,,,,,points while describing,n
25,2,19,M,3,5,2,24:18:00,I remember it being two triangles next to each other except not together this one had a dot in each corners with a dot on the line segment um I think this one was a bit more obtuse than this one and this one's only a little bit obtuse they weren't symmetrical or not symmetrical but um they weren't the same uh triangles shapes and size cause I can't remember math terms right now um so yeah ,y,24:58:00,0:40,40,6,78,,,,,gestures while describing,n
25,2,24,M,5,5,2,32:21:00,it's just two diamond uh shapes connected like diamond here with a dot in each of its point connected in the middle to a diamond here connected with a dot in each of its or with a dot in each of its points connected by the center point of diamond one diamond two ,y,32:46:00,0:25,25,2,54,,,,,points and gestures while describing,n
