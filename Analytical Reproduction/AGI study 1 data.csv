3,2,1,M,0:13,Um there's like an acute er type of triangle like uh two dots with a dot to the right and the next triangle's like a off center diamond almost it has four dots ,0,0,0:39,26,33,3,0:26,,,,,2,1,0,y
10,2,1,M,0:15,SO there's one triangle shape like that and then next to it is kind of a tilted squarish thing shaped like that ,2,1,0:27,12,22,0,0:12,,,,,0,2,0,y
12,2,1,M,0:23,Uh two one triangle and then a rhombus er a kite or something,0,0,0:35,12,13,3,0:12,,,,,4,0,0,y
13,2,1,M,0:10,Okay make so I'm gonna make a triangle that has a straight line there so that's the triangle and then I'm going to make a square that's very kinda tight and angled okay,2,1,0:28,18,33,0,0:18,,,,,4,1,0,y
27,2,1,M,0:13,So there's basically um a triangle like shape with lines and a diamond like shape with lines as well,0,0,0:29,16,19,1,0:16,,,,,3,1,0,y
30,2,1,M,0:12,Okay so there is one triangle on the left side and then there's a square that's kind of stretched out on the other side and then they are outlined by lines and the corners are dots,0,0,0:28,16,36,0,0:16,,,,,2,1,0,y
34,2,1,M,0:09,Okay there's two there's two shapes one of them is a triangle with dots at each corner at one of them is like a um rhombus type thing,0,0,0:23,14,28,2,0:14,,,,,5,1,0,y
49,2,1,M,0:11,There's one triangle that's oretty wide and then there's another shape that looks kinda like a trapezoid like that,1,1,0:34,23,19,0,0:23,,,,,2,1,0,y
58,2,1,M,0:10,Okay so these two shapes this one is a wide triangle with three dots on each corner and this one is kind of like two of these wide triangles but together but I don't have oh yeah I do so it's kind of like this it's like half of this one ,3,1,0:41,31,51,2,0:31,,,,,2,2,0,y
1,2,2,G,0:56,uh there is a it’s a hexagon with a point on each intersection and then a dot in the middle,0,0,1:02,6,20,2,0:06,BI hexagon; BI points; LI dot middle,3,,,2,4,1,y

6,3,2,M,1:03,Alright so that's a hexagon with a dot in the middle and then dots on each of the edges ,0,0,1:20,17,19,0,0:17,,,,,2,1,0,y
11,3,2,M,0:30,So it's a I want to say it's a pentagon but they all have corners er dots at the corners and then there's a middle dot but none of them are connected it's just the outer ring is connected ,0,0,0:46,16,39,2,0:16,,,,,2,1,0,y
14,3,2,M,0:55,So it's like a hexagram yeah and then there's one in the middle so they're all connected and then there's one in the middle ,0,0,1:12,17,24,0,0:17,,,,,3,4,2,y
16,3,2,M,1:03,Okay so this one is a hexagon with a dot in the center kinda looks like cyclohexane,0,0,1:20,17,17,0,0:17,,,,,1,3,0,y
22,3,2,M,1:02,Alrighty okay so there is a dot in the center and then tehre are uh connecting dots around it and what is uh hexagram around it um the dots here are not connected to the center dot ,1,1,1:24,22,37,3,0:22,,,,Points to figure,5,4,4,y
35,3,2,M,1:04,Uh Okay so there's like a six sided shape I don't remember what they're called and then it's got a dot right in the middle,0,0,1:15,11,25,1,0:11,,,,,4,3,2,y
37,3,2,M,0:56,Uh ok so I have one in the middle right here and then I have just an outlying pattern right here and I'm pretty sure yeah it's an octagon ,2,1,1:08,12,29,1,0:12,,,,,1,4,0,y
54,3,2,M,0:56,Okay so this an uh hexagon I don't know I don't know geometry but um at each end of the hexagon there  is dots um and then there's a dot in the center of it as well ,0,0,1:17,21,37,3,0:21,,,,,2,0,0,y
55,3,2,M,0:51,It is an I would say an octagon something of that sort with a free floating dot in the middle and then lines connecting all the outside dots ,0,0,1:08,17,28,0,0:17,,,,,2,2,0,y
57,3,2,M,1:01,Okay so um there's there's three points on one side kind of like a triangle another triangle and two dots on the other side and then there's one in the middle,0:00,0,1:22,21,31,2,0:21,,,,Can't hear ending,3,0,0,y

43,2,3,M,2:33,Okayso I'm making a rectangle with a dot in the middle and then under it we have two dots there's a line ,0,0,2:55,22,22,0,0:22,,,,Points to figure,3,2,1,y
49,2,3,M,1:25,There is a rectangle with a dot in each corner with a dot in the middle and then a line at the bottom with two dots at each er a dot at each end ,0,0,1:40,15,34,1,0:15,,,,,4,2,1,y
58,2,3,M,1:39,Okay so this is a rectangle with four dots on each corner and a dot in the middle and a small straight line with two dots on the end ,1,1,1:56,17,29,0,0:17,,,,,2,1,0,y
7,1,4,M,1:49,This is a have a trapezoid with a dot at each end and coming off the bottom of that is a triangle with a dot at each end of it,0,0,2:08,19,30,1,0:19,,,,,0,1,0,y
8,1,4,M,2:49,So there's a trapezoid and on this side with dots at each corner and a dot in the middle that's connected to a triangle with dots at each corner,1,1,3:09,20,29,0,0:20,,,,,2,2,2,y
9,1,4,M,2:14,IT's two dots it's um five sided figure er four sided figure and then a triangle coming out the end of it something like that and then a line is connecting all the points ,1,1,2:32,18,34,2,0:18,,,,,1,2,0,y
15,1,4,M,2:26,Okay so it's like a rhombus with a dot in the middle of the longer line forming a triangle with two more dots ,0,0,2:38,12,23,0,0:12,,,,,3,4,2,y
19,1,4,M,2:59,So there is a trapezoid right here with a triangle eight next to it,1,1,3:14,15,14,0,0:15,BB,,1,,1,4,0,y
24,1,4,M,2:53,Okay this one there's a short line two dots and then two lines coming out of it a line down here and then a dot between that line that is the top of the triangle down here like that,3,1,3:17,24,39,0,0:24,,,,Points to figure,4,3,3,y
28,1,4,M,2:48,It's a trapezium with dots on all corners there's a triangle over here like at the bottom with dots on all corners,1,1,3:03,15,22,0,0:15,,,,,2,1,0,y
31,1,4,M,1:59,Alright there's a trapezoid with a dot at each corner and then a triangle right below it,0,0,2:12,13,17,0,0:13,,,,,0,4,0,y
32,1,4,M,1:38,So there is um a I don't remember the name of that shape but it's got a triangle next to it and it has like four lines and a triangle next to it ,0,0,1:56,18,33,2,0:18,,,,,1,1,0,y
33,1,4,M,2:15,Okay there's uh a shape with four points which I don't remember what to call it um and it's got a dot in the middle of the two points on the right side and that dot is connected to a triangle,0,0,2:44,29,41,2,0:29,,,,,2,2,0,y
44,1,4,M,1:58,Uh there's a trapezoid on its side on the left that has five dots and connected to the trapezoid is a triangle on the right ,0,0,2:12,14,25,1,0:14,,,,,1,1,0,y
46,2,4,NG,1:52,Okay so there is a already forgetting what that is it is a form of rectangle that is not a rectangle where uh one side is larger than its opposite but then the two others are the same um and it has a dot at each of the corners slash intersections and in the middle of the longest like hypotenuse or whatever of the um bottom of it there is a black dot and off of that black dot there is a triangle and those triangle and that triangle also has a black dot at each of the three corners ,0,0,2:32,40,100,4,0:40,,,,,5,4,4,y
47,1,4,M,2:43,So yeah it's kinda looking like a triangle that's made up of line segments that's like connected by connected to forgot the name of that shape but we're just gonna roll with it boop and then go boop ,1,1,3:14,31,38,1,0:31,,,,,1,2,0,y
48,1,4,M,2:06,So there's a trapezoid on its side with a dot at each corner and then connected to that is a triangle with a dot at each corner ,0,0,2:22,16,27,0,0:16,,,,,4,4,4,y
60,1,4,M,2:53,There is oh oh make okay os there's a triangle that's connected to a um so pentagon and it has circles at every corner of the shape ,0,0,3:37,44,27,2,0:44,,,,,0,1,0,y
7,1,5,M,2:32,So you have a triangle with a dot at each end and also a dot in the middle of the hypotenuse and next to that you have another triangle with a dot at each end ,0,0,2:52,20,35,0,0:20,,,,,0,2,0,y
8,1,5,M,3:44,Okay so there's two different triangles um one is like a right triangle and then there's dots at each corner and then a dot on its longest side in the middle and then another triangle on its side that has a dot at each corner,0,0,4:11,27,45,1,0:27,,,,,4,2,0,y
9,1,5,M,3:05,So it's two triangles next to each other um one is a right triangle with a point at all the ends and then one point in the middle of the hypotenuse and then one is just a triangle its um adjacent to it with only four er only three points ,0,0,3:30,25,50,3,0:25,,,,,1,3,1,y
15,1,5,M,3:05,Okay it's one right triangle and with another not right triangle um with the right triangle having a dot in the line its longest line,0,0,3:26,21,25,1,0:21,,,,,1,1,0,y
18,1,5,M,3:28,Okay so um we got two different types of triangles I don't remember what those are from geometry but it's alright one's a 90 degrees with little dots throughout and one looks like an isosceles like that ,1,1,3:50,22,37,1,0:22,,,,,4,5,2,y
19,1,5,M,3:44,Okay there's a triangle with these corners and a dot right here and then another triangle next to it um with a dot on each corner ,2,1,4:04,20,26,1,0:20,,,,,2,2,0,y
24,1,5,M,3:46,Okay this one there's a triangle that has three dots along one line and then one in the corner at the 90 degree angle and then next to it on its right side there's the triangle like that,1,1,4:09,23,38,0,0:23,,,,,3,3,3,y
28,1,5,M,3:43,It's a right angle triangle with dots on all corners and dot on the hypotenuse and the other's a regular triangle with dots on all sides ,0,0,4:01,18,26,0,0:18,,,,,2,0,0,y
31,1,5,M,2:41,There's two triangles dot at each corner and then a dot in the middle of the big one and then a dot at each corner of the small one ,0,0,2:54,13,29,0,0:13,,,,,2,3,2,y
32,1,5,M,2:20,So there's a triangle with has like an extra dot in the middle and then there's another triangle next to it,0,0,2:31,11,21,0,0:11,,,,,2,0,0,y
33,1,5,M,3:03,Okay there's a triangle with a right angle at the um bottom right and there's dot on every end and then there's also a dot in the middle of the like lsanted line and then there's another triangle to the right of the other triangle with dots on each corner,0,0,3:35,32,50,1,0:32,,,,,2,1,0,y
44,1,5,M,2:42,Uh on the left ehre's a triangle that consists of a fourth dot on the uh on the longer leg the um I can't remember the term for it uh and then on the right there's another triangle that's taller and skinnier,0,0,3:03,21,42,4,0:21,,,,,1,3,1,y
46,2,5,NG,2:52,Okay so there is a triangle um it's a right triangle so it's like a 50 degree angle in the right corner and it has a dot on each of the three corners and it has one in the middle of the hypotenuse and the other one looks like an obtuse triangle it's next to it not touching at all and it has three black dots they're only on the um the corners,0,0,3:21,29,73,2,0:29,,,,,1,2,0,y
47,1,5,M,3:50,IT's looking like kind of a isosceles triangle and like a no I think that's an equilateral triangle I don't know but boop boop they're like not connected this time kinda just doing their own thing ,1,1,4:25,35,36,1,0:35,,,,,0,2,0,y
48,1,5,M,2:44,So there's a traingle with four dots and one dot's on the longest side and then next to it is another triangle with a dot at each corner both are on their side,0,0,3:00,16,33,0,0:16,,,,,2,2,3,y
56,1,5,M,5:25,Okay so a right triangle is on the left side um there are points at each corner as well as a point in the middle of the hypotenuse and then there is another triangle next to it um I guess it's isosceles and uh there are points at each end ,0,0,5:56,31,50,3,0:31,,,,,3,3,2,y
60,1,5,M,4:05,So there is a triangle so there's a triangle with four points and it and there's a point between two points and then there's another triangle that's next to it with three points ,0,0,4:40,35,33,1,0:35,,,,,2,2,0,y
5,3,6,M,4:03,So I'm making another right triangle and at the top and at the bottom I am making another triangle um with its longest side facing the upper triangle ,0,0,4:23,20,28,1,0:20,,,,,4,3,1,y
6,3,6,M,3:47,Ok so this one's a triangle with a dot in the middle on this side and then another triangle that doesn't have a dot in the middle underneath,1,1,4:02,15,28,0,0:15,,,,,2,2,0,y
11,3,6,M,3:24,So you have a right triangle so these are all connected and you have a line er dot in the middle of this line and you have another triangle that has these two connected and then this one connected and these this one'd be connected,4,1,3:44,20,45,2,0:20,,,,"Points ot figure at ""middle of this line""",2,2,0,y
14,3,6,M,3:30,So so there's like a triangle like that and then there's another triangle like this so that's a triangle and then that's atriangle ,2,1,3:44,14,23,1,0:14,RP,,1,Pointing to figure without description,4,2,2,y
16,3,6,M,4:11,Alright so this one is another right triangle and it actually has a dot  in the center of the line and this one is another triangle but it doesn't have a dot on the center of the line only on the corners ,2,1,4:29,18,42,0,0:18,,,,,1,2,1,y
22,3,6,M,4:13,Alrighty um so there is uh two triangles one is uh a 90 degree angle that has dots at each corner and then one across from the 90 degree angle hypotenuse and then there is another triangle where there are just three dots connected uh at the corners ,0,0,4:37,24,48,4,0:24,,,,Points to figure,1,1,0,y
26,3,6,M,4:32,There's a triangle with four dots with a dot in the middle and there's another triangle which has three dots ,0,0,4:44,12,20,0,0:12,,,,,3,1,0,y
37,3,6,M,3:04,Uh ok so I've got a triangle here uh with one dot in the middle with one of the lines and then I've got another triangle down here that's a little slimmer its hypotenuse is really long ,2,1,3:20,16,37,2,0:16,,,,,2,2,4,y
45,3,6,M,2:51,This is two triangles one like this and one like that touching each other,2,1,3:00,9,14,0,0:09,,,,,3,2,1,y
51,3,6,M,2:59,So it's a triangle with another more wider triangle ,0,0,3:12,13,9,0,0:13,,,,,3,1,1,y
54,3,6,M,4:37,Okay there's two triangles the one the one on top has I think  well two sides are the same length and then the other one is longer and there is there's dots on each end of the corners and then there's a dot in the middle of the longest line of the triangle and then the bottom triangle um all sides are different lengths and there is a circle at each corner of that triangle as well ,0,0,5:12,35,77,2,0:35,,,,,3,3,2,y
57,3,6,M,4:12,So so there's a triangle at the top it looks like a 45 45 90 and then there's another triangle obtuse triangle up on the right ,0,0,4:35,23,26,1,0:23,,,,,3,1,0,y
5,3,7,M,4:48,Okay so I'm making another trapezoid but the trapezoid is on the top and it's kind of like standing um it looks like a lamp ,0,0,5:05,17,25,1,0:17,,,,,5,0,1,y
6,3,7,M,4:30,So there's a trapezoid with a dot in the middle there's a line directly beneath it with a dot in the middle and at the end ,0,0,4:45,15,26,0,0:15,,,,,3,1,1,y
11,3,7,M,4:14,So you have a you have three lines and then it's attached these are all connected and then you have a rhombus at the top of it that's connected and this would be in the middle of the bottom line,2,1,4:31,17,40,1,0:17,RP,,,Points to figure,4,4,1,y
14,3,7,M,4:08,So okay so this one's like a line and then it connects to a trapezoid like that,1,1,4:21,13,17,1,0:13,,,,,3,1,1,y
16,3,7,M,5:14,Alright so this looks like a little box that you could stand on and then it has a line with two dots coming out the bottom ,0,0,5:30,16,26,0,0:16,,,,,2,1,0,y
22,3,7,M,4:58,Alrighty okay um so there is well like half of like a hexagon shape so you have um the four corners of like the half hexagon I guess it's more like a trapezoid um and then you also have um a fifth dot in the middle of the bottom of the trapezoid connected by a line between two other dots at the bottom ,0,0,5:36,38,63,5,0:38,,,,,4,3,2,y
25,3,7,M,3:34,Okay there's a trapezoid with dots on each vertice and then one dot on the longest side and then three dots coming out of it with lines in between them ,0,0,3:54,20,30,0,0:20,,,,Points to screen,0,3,0,y
26,3,7,M,5:11,It's a shape at the top that has five dots well four dots at each corner and a middle and then two dots at the ends going down ,0,0,5:26,15,28,1,0:15,,,,,4,4,3,y
37,3,7,M,3:40,Uh it kinda looks like an umbrella so it's like this and then so you've got a line going to the base of the trapezoid and it form an umbrella kinda like that,2,1,3:52,12,33,1,0:12,,,,Points to figure,2,3,2,y
51,3,7,M,3:31,A trapezoid and a line underneath ,0,0,3:40,9,6,0,0:09,,,,,3,3,2,y
54,3,7,M,5:39,Okay so there's another rhombus and um at each corner there is like a dot and then in the center of the bottom line there's also a dot and there's a line going off the center dot and in the center of the line there's anoteher dot at the end of the line there's another dot equal spacing apart ,0,0,6:00,21,59,1,0:21,,,,Points to figure,2,1,0,y
10,2,8,M,5:02,There's a tilted square with corners on each end and then the the bottom left one makes an attachment to um another tilted square with corners at each end ,0,0,5:21,19,29,1,0:19,,,,,3,3,2,y
13,2,8,M,3:58,Make okay this is two rhombi next to each other all of them with dots ,0,0,4:10,12,15,0,0:12,,,,,5,3,2,y
20,2,8,M,4:36,Okay there are diamonds and every corner has a dot but both of the rectangles are put together close and there's one that's put in the middle ,0,0,4:58,22,27,0,0:22,,,,,3,0,0,y
21,2,8,M,6:23,These are two parallelograms with a point on each angle ,0,0,6:54,31,10,0,0:31,,,,,5,0,0,y
30,2,8,M,4:54,Okay so there's two squares and they share a corner they're kind of yeah they're both the same shape and size and just share a corner ,0,0,5:13,19,26,1,0:19,,,,,3,2,0,y
34,2,8,M,3:52,Um there's two trapezoids or parallelograms or something and they're connected at the corner ,0,0,4:04,12,14,1,0:12,,,,,5,2,2,y
7,1,9,M,5:36,So you have an upside down triangle with dots at each end of it and connected to the bottom dot you have a rectangle coming off of that with um dots at each corner of the rectangle,0,0,5:55,19,37,1,0:19,,,,,4,5,4,y
8,1,9,M,7:41,So there is a triangle upside down dots at each of the three corners um and then that um is connected to a rectangle um with four dots at each corner well one dot at each of the four corners and the dot in the middle is connected to the triangles,0,0,8:03,22,51,3,0:22,,,,,3,1,1,y
9,1,9,M,6:29,So this is a triangle on top of uh on top of box and they're and there's a point for each of the corners of the box and a point for the um each of the points of the triangle ,0,0,6:45,16,40,4,0:16,,,,,4,4,4,y
15,1,9,M,6:39,So it's a triangle on top connected to a rectangle a dot at each line connection,0,0,6:50,11,16,0,0:11,,,,,0,4,1,y
18,1,9,M,6:23,Okay so we have a triangle on top and then we have a kind of a line segment there and then a square er rectangle on the bottom and they are touching at this point centralized point there ,2,1,6:47,24,38,1,0:24,,,,Points to figure,2,3,0,y
19,1,9,M,6:59,Okay there's a triangle on the top with a rectangle right beneath it and they're connected by the triangle's point ,0,0,7:13,14,20,0,0:14,,,,Points at figure,3,0,0,y
23,1,9,M,6:58,So there are the triangle it's like upside down and then there is a rectangle that is connected to it by the bottom ,0,0,7:13,15,23,0,0:15,,,,,3,3,2,y
24,1,9,M,7:25,Okay this one there's a triangle on the top like this and then this dot of the triangle goes through the line of the rectangle that's on the bottom of it like that ,3,1,7:42,17,33,0,0:17,,,,,3,1,1,y
31,1,9,M,5:11,Okay so it's a rectangle with a dot at each corner and then a dot in the middle one of the sides of the triangle ,0,0,5:25,14,25,0,0:14,,,,,3,5,3,y
32,1,9,M,4:41,So there is a triangle on the top connected into a rectangle below it,0,0,4:48,7,14,0,0:07,,,,,4,4,0,y
33,1,9,M,6:13,Alright there's um an upside down triangle on the top with dots on each corner and then there's a rectangle on the bottom with dots on each corner and also a dot where it connects with the triangle ,0,0,6:29,16,38,1,0:16,,,,,5,3,2,y
44,1,9,M,5:54,Uh this has uh a rectangle on the bottom it's the same four points and a fifth point on the top line making a triangle on top of it,0,0,6:09,15,29,2,0:15,,,,,5,3,2,y
47,1,9,M,7:40,It looks like just an equilateral triangle connected to a rectangle like that,1,1,8:03,23,13,0,0:23,,,,,3,3,2,y
48,1,9,M,5:50,So there's an upside down triangle with a dot at each corner and below that is a square with a dot at each corner,0,0,6:03,13,24,0,0:13,,,,,0,3,0,y
52,1,9,M,7:38,Okay um so on the bottom there is a um rectangle and on the top there is a triangle there are points on all corners of the rectangle um and points on all corners um of the intersecting lines at the triangle which is on top of the rectangle ,0,0,8:01,23,49,4,0:23,,,,,1,0,0,y
60,1,9,M,7:33,So there's a triangle on the top of a rectangle and it they are connected with a point between them there's a point in every corner f the shapes ,0,0,8:01,28,29,1,0:28,,,,,2,1,0,y
13,2,10,M,4:50,Okay so this this this is a similar shape from earlier it's a lot of angles coming out from the center point and they all have dots ,0,0,5:04,14,27,2,0:14,,,,,5,5,3,y
20,2,10,M,5:52,There is um six lines and the ending of every line is a dot and there's one rght in the middle that connects all of them,0,0,6:14,22,26,1,0:22,,,,,1,3,0,y
21,2,10,M,8:03,This is six intersecting lines with a point on each end and a point in the middle,0,0,8:23,20,17,0,0:20,,,,,3,3,0,y
30,2,10,M,6:10,Soit's kind of like a snowflake and there's a dot in the middle and dots all around it and there's line that come off the dots to the middle dot ,0,0,6:21,11,30,0,0:11,,,,,3,0,0,y
34,2,10,M,4:57,Um there's a dot in the middle with three wait well five lines coming off of that side again ,0,0,5:04,7,19,1,0:07,,,,,5,3,0,y
43,2,10,M,11:01,Okay so now I'm gonna make okay so I'm making just a straight line with a dot at the top and bottom and a dot in the middle and then  at that middle there's an x  an x at the middle of that line with dots at each corner ,0,0,11:35,34,49,2,0:34,,,,,4,3,0,y
49,2,10,M,5:08,There are three lines that are all um connecting to each other ,0,0,5:27,19,12,1,0:19,,,,,3,3,3,y
5,3,11,M,7:45,I'm making what looks like a parallelogram uh base on the dots here and they're connect there are parallelograms on top of this trapezoid,2,1,8:05,20,24,2,0:20,,,,,2,3,0,y
6,3,11,M,7:07,So there's a parallelogram on top with dots at each corner and a trapezoid that shares two of the dots one in the middle and then the other two on the outside ,0,0,7:21,14,32,0,0:14,,,,,2,3,0,y
11,3,11,M,6:53,So you have a diamond with dots that uh and they're all connected and then it's connected to a rhombus which also has dots on all corners and then a middle dot with the bottom line,0,0,7:15,22,36,1,0:22,,,,Drops dot in the middle,1,2,0,y
14,3,11,M,6:38,So there's like a diamond like that and then it connects to a trapezoid so here's a diamond and there's a trapezoid ,3,1,6:50,12,22,0,0:12,RP,,1,Pointing to figure,3,2,0,y
16,3,11,M,8:10,Alright so this one looks like another little box that you can stand on and then it has a rectangle coming off the top of it but the bottom two dots of the rectangle are the top two dots from the box,0,0,8:34,24,42,0,0:24,,,,Keeps talking after done making,2,3,2,y
22,3,11,M,8:06,Alrighty um so there's a trapezoid at the bottom that is kind of like connected to a parallelogram shape the trapezoid at the bottom has um five dots four at the corners and then one in the middle and then the parallelogram is connected like this,1,1,8:34,28,46,2,0:28,,,,,1,2,0,y
25,3,11,M,6:39,Okay there's a diamond on the top and then a trapezoid on the bottom and they're connected to each other ,0,0,6:49,10,20,0,0:10,,,,,4,4,2,y
26,3,11,M,8:36,Okay um like a sideways diamond at the top with four dots mayde a sideways square another shape at the bottom with one two three dots ,0,0,8:59,23,26,1,0:23,,,,,3,3,3,y
35,3,11,M,8:25,Uh okay we've got like a rhombus looking thing on the bottom and then on the top there's a parallelgoram and make this kinda shape again with dots at each corner and a dot in the middle uh on the bottom of the rhombus,0,0,8:46,21,44,2,0:21,,,,Points to figure,5,5,3,y
51,3,11,M,5:35,It's a trapezoid with a with a rhombus I think shape,0,0,5:53,18,11,0,0:18,,,,,2,3,1,y
54,3,11,M,8:55,Um okay so there's a parallelogram with dots at each end of it and then the two dots on the bottom are also the top of a rhombus and there's also dots at each corner of the rhombus and then there's one dot in the middle at the bottom line of the rhombus ,0,0,9:22,27,53,1,0:27,,,,Points to figure,0,2,0,y
55,3,11,M,6:25,It is a trapezoid with a dot in the middle of the longest line on the bottom with a rhombus coming off of the top of it pointing to the right ,0,0,6:40,15,31,0,0:15,,,,,1,1,0,y
57,3,11,M,8:41,There's like another parallelogram at the top with four points and then there's a trapezoid on the bottom with five points the two points are shared between them,0,0,8:56,15,28,0,0:15,,,,,2,2,0,y
7,1,12,M,7:41,SO you have a rhombus with dots at each corner and a triangle also with dots at each corner ,0,0,7:57,16,19,0,0:16,,,,,0,2,0,y
8,1,12,M,10:13,Um so there's kinda like a diamond with four dots one dot in each of the four corners um and then there's a triangle that is kinda like diagonally underneath it um that also has a dot in each corner,0,0,10:41,28,40,3,0:28,,,,,4,5,3,y
9,1,12,M,8:59,Those two figures um one is looks like a parallelogram the other is a triangle uh and the triangle's a little bit below the parallelogram and they have points at all the corners,0,0,9:17,18,33,2,0:18,,,,,4,4,1,y
15,1,12,M,9:41,So one diamond and one triangle ,0,0,9:48,7,6,0,0:07,,,,,4,4,0,y
18,1,12,M,9:32,So we have a diamond on the top with points at all its  axes and then we have a triangle on the bottom like that,1,1,9:49,17,25,0,0:17,,,,,4,4,4,y
19,1,12,M,9:27,Okay so there's a parallelogram trapezoid diamond whatever at the top and then right next to it is a triangle yup,0,0,9:47,20,21,2,0:20,,,,,2,3,0,y
23,1,12,M,9:14,So this is like a diamond as well and then a triangle that's upside down faced toward the diamond ,0,0,9:23,9,19,0,0:09,,,,,4,1,0,y
24,1,12,M,10:27,Alright this one there's a square up here like this with four dots on the end and then to its bottom left there is a triangle shaped like that ,2,1,10:48,21,29,0,0:21,,,,,2,4,2,y
28,1,12,M,7:00,It's a parallelogram with dots on all corners and this is a triangle on the bottom separate,1,1,7:11,11,17,0,0:11,,,,,3,4,2,y
31,1,12,M,7:08,There's a rhombus and then there's a smaller there's  a triangle right below it ,0,0,7:17,9,14,1,0:09,,,,,2,5,2,y
32,1,12,M,6:02,So there is a diamond up here with a triangle to the left and below,1,1,6:10,8,15,0,0:08,,,,,4,4,3,y
33,1,12,M,8:13,Alright there's um a rhombus on the top um with dots on each corner and then underneath it is a triangle with dots on each corner ,0,0,8:29,16,26,2,0:16,,,,,3,1,0,y
44,1,12,M,7:53,Uh in this there's a parallelgram in the top right uh not connected to a triangle that's placed below it ,0,0,8:07,14,20,2,0:14,,,,,4,5,4,y
47,1,12,M,10:36,So I think it's a parallelogram and then it's disconnected from the isosceles triangle there's nothing connecting them but yeah like that ,1,1,10:59,23,22,0,0:23,,,,,4,5,3,y
48,1,12,M,7:45,SO there's a diamond at the top dots at each of its corners and below it is a di er triangle with a dot at each of its corners ,0,0,8:00,15,29,1,0:15,,,,,5,5,5,y
52,1,12,M,11:06,Make we've got a slightly slanted um square and then beneath that there is with points on all four corners there is a triangle with points on all the corners as well ,0,0,11:27,21,32,1,0:21,,,,,1,3,0,y

34,2,14,M,6:52,Um there's a trianlge with a dot at each corner and in between two of the lines two dots on the outside,0,0,7:01,9,22,1,0:09,,,,,3,1,0,y
43,2,14,M,14:53,Um there is a large triangle it has three dots at each corner and then the two lines on the side it has a dot in themiddle of them each line and then at the bottom corner of the triangle there are two dots apart two dots,0,0,15:40,47,47,1,0:47,,,,,4,3,3,y
49,2,14,M,7:20,There's an equilateral triangle that's upside down with a dot on each corner and then coming down at and then just two dots on the outside of it,0,0,7:37,17,28,0,0:17,,,,,3,2,2,y
58,2,14,M,10:28,Um this is an upside down triangle and there's two dots in the middle of each line and there's two dots on each er three dots on each corner and then there's two dots just sitting along side of it near the top er the bottom ,0,0,11:02,34,46,3,0:34,,,,,2,2,0,y
7,1,15,M,9:40,You have a triangle with one short side and two longer sides of equal length with a dot at each corner and coming off of that you have a triangle with a longer side and two shorter sides that equally equal in length with a dot in the center of the longest side ,0,0,10:17,37,53,1,0:37,,,,,5,2,2,y
8,1,15,M,13:03,Um so there are two triangles one triangle is pointed down and is very long with three dots at each corner and then there is another triangle kinda in the middle that with three dots one at each corner and then there's a dot in the middle of top of the triangle ,0,0,13:29,26,52,1,0:26,,,,,5,3,3,y
9,1,15,M,11:35,So this is two triangles one is sort of in the middle of the other they're both pointing down wards and there's dots at each of the edges and there's one dot that goes along the line of the smaller triangle the bottom line er top line of the smaller triangle ,0,0,11:58,23,51,1,0:23,,,,,3,3,0,y
15,1,15,M,11:16,Okay so two um triangles um one just going through the other with a line across it from the other triangle and then like two dots in the middle ,0,0,11:37,21,29,2,0:21,,,,,4,2,1,y
19,1,15,M,12:00,Okay so there's a triangle and in the middle of the triangle there's another one going through it that's kinda small ,0,0,12:18,18,21,0,0:18,,,,,4,2,1,y
23,1,15,M,10:59,So there's a triangle that's upside down that's pointed downwards with two dots in the middle um yeah two dots in the middle and a triangle at each point I mean there's a dot at each point of the triangle and then there's another triangle that's combined with the other triangle that has two dots on the left and right side of it,0,0,11:25,26,63,3,0:26,,,,Points to figure,2,3,1,y
24,1,15,M,12:40,Okay this one there's a skinny triangle it's upside down two dots here and then going through it there's a dot in the middle that makes a line for another triangle that's has two dots with the bigger triangle,1,1,13:01,21,39,0,0:21,,,,,3,4,3,y
32,1,15,M,7:32,So there is a triangle here and another triangle that intersects it and its got an extra dot on the longest side ,1,1,7:42,10,22,0,0:10,,,,,2,5,2,y
33,1,15,M,9:55,There's um a triangle with dots on each corner going down and then intersecting that is another triangle with dots on each corner pointing down and then there's a dot um like in the middle ,0,0,10:21,26,35,2,0:26,,,,,5,1,1,y
44,1,15,M,9:59,Uh through the middle of this objects there's a long triangle that has another triangle cutting through it but there's two points in the middle ,0,0,10:18,19,25,1,0:19,,,,,4,3,2,y
47,1,15,M,12:53,what okay this is more like a isosceles triangle that's connected to an equilateral triangle that meet here so it's like boop and then boop yeah so it's basically like that oh I did that yeah ,4,1,13:24,31,36,0,0:31,,,,Points to figure,3,2,0,y
48,1,15,M,9:43,So there's an upside triangle with three dots one at each corner in the center is a dot and connected to that is another triangle ,0,0,9:59,16,25,0,0:16,,,,,3,3,1,y
52,1,15,M,13:23,oo okay so this is a triangle um with points on all three corners and then another triangle going kind of in the center of the first triangle with points on all three corners as well and there's also a point in the middle of the line um yes,0,0,13:48,25,49,2,0:25,,,,Points to screen,0,2,0,y
56,1,15,M,19:54,So there's a triangle pointing uh downwards um with a point on each corner uh there's another more elongated triangle in the center of this triangle overlapping with it um with points at each corner and a point uh in the er in the middle of the longest line and uh at the end corner of the skinnier triangle uh to differentiate er to end the the shape  of the second triangle ,0,0,20:50,56,72,8,0:56,,,,Points to figure,1,2,0,y
60,1,15,M,11:39,There is a triangle and three points at the end of it and within that triangle there's another triangle in it with three points with four points in it and a point in the middle of both ,0,0,12:03,24,37,0,0:24,,,,,0,2,0,y
5,3,16,M,11:53,So I'm making what looks like a bow um and there's three dots on opposite side and there's a central dot at the bottom ,0,0,12:09,16,24,1,0:16,,,,,1,1,0,y
6,3,16,M,10:22,So there's two triangles where they share a central dot and then there's a dot on each of the ends of the triangles and the one dot in the middle of each ,0,0,10:36,14,32,0,0:14,,,,,4,2,2,y
11,3,16,M,10:16,So you have a dot in the middle and then you have two triangles that come off of it so this would be connected and this would be connected and this would be connected to that and that's like that two triangles just complementing each other ,4,1,10:36,20,46,0,0:20,,,,,2,2,0,y
14,3,16,M,9:30,So there's a triangle there's two traingles and they're connected like that so they both connect at this middle point and then there's like a dot in the middle of each of the base of the triangles,2,1,9:45,15,37,1,0:15,RP,,,Pointing to figure,1,2,2,y
16,3,16,M,11:42,Alright so these are two triangles that are connected together they kind of look like a bow tie and there's a dot in the center and then three dots on either side of the lines connecting them,0,0,11:59,17,37,0,0:17,,,,,1,2,0,y
22,3,16,M,11:35,Alrighty so there are two triangles connected at their tips I guess the top points um so this is connecting both triangles this dot it this dot here here is perfectly symmetrical here here and then there are two dots there so this is a line connecting the triangles and then like that and then there's a line with space for each of them ,5,1,12:06,31,64,2,0:31,,,,Points to figure,0,0,0,y
25,3,16,M,10:05,Okay there are two triangles touching each other um and then the tip of the triangle is the thing that's connecting it and then there are dots in the middle of each triangle with the longest line and then on each vertice ,0,0,10:31,26,42,1,0:26,RP,,,Pointing to figure and screen,3,1,0,y
26,3,16,M,12:56,There's a triangle on the left side with three dots at each corner and a dot in the middle and it's a triangle on the right side with uh two dots at this corner one corner and a dot in the middle,0,0,13:17,21,42,1,0:21,,,,,3,3,2,y
37,3,16,M,9:17,Okay so I've got two triangles that connect uh where there's a corner to the triangle and then on the hypotenuse again we have halfway point dots um yeah,0,0,9:36,19,29,2,0:19,,,,,5,5,3,y
45,3,16,M,7:27,Uh these are two triangles touching the middle facing each other ,0,0,7:35,8,11,1,0:08,,,,,2,0,0,y
54,3,16,M,13:16,Okay it kinda looks like butterfly wings there's like two triangles that are both like exactly the same they have circles at each corner of them and they're connected by like one dot in the center and then in the middle well near each of the longest lines there's dots also ,0,0,13:46,30,51,0,0:30,,,,Points to figure,5,5,5,y
55,3,16,M,9:48,Um two equal triangles with dots on all the vertices and they are pointing and touching each other in the middle and on the outer lines where the hypotenuse is there's a dot in the middle ,0,0,10:05,17,36,1,0:17,,,,Points to figure,2,2,1,y
57,3,16,M,12:53,So there's two triangles connected in the middle by one point and then each triangle has three points with the middle one shared so four total points for each triangle ,0,0,13:12,19,30,0,0:19,,,,,1,2,0,y
7,1,17,M,11:22,You have a large square with dots at each corner and on the bottom side of the square you have a dot and coming from that dot you have a triangle inside the square also with dots at each corner,0,0,11:46,24,40,0,0:24,,,,,1,1,0,y
8,1,17,M,15:04,So there's a large square with dots in each corner one of them in the middle of the square there's atriangle facing down with three points with dots in each corner and the bottom point  of the triangle has dot on the bottom line of the square,0,0,15:25,21,47,0,0:21,,,,,4,3,2,y

19,1,17,M,13:38,Okay there's a big square rectangle and in the middle uh of the triangle and each shape has points on each corner,0,0,13:58,20,22,1,0:20,,,,,3,0,0,y
24,1,17,M,14:36,This one there's a big square that has a little triangle in the middle of it and a dot that goes on the line of the big square and there's four dots on the big square and three dots on the ends of the triangle ,0,0,14:56,20,45,0,0:20,,,,,2,2,1,y
28,1,17,M,10:08,It's a square with dots on all corners and inside the square there's a small triangle with dots on all corners,0,0,10:22,14,21,0,0:14,,,,,4,3,1,y
31,1,17,M,10:18,There's a big rectangle with a dot at each corner and a dot in the middle of this one and then a triangle coming out of it ,1,1,10:34,16,27,0,0:16,,,,,4,4,3,y
32,1,17,M,8:31,So there is a big rectangle on the outside with a little triangle inside ,0,0,8:38,7,14,0,0:07,,,,,5,2,0,y
33,1,17,M,11:23,Alright there's a square with dots on each corner and in the square um at the bottom is a triangle going down with dots on each corner,0,0,11:43,20,27,1,0:20,,,,,2,3,0,y
44,1,17,M,11:32,Uh this shape is a large square that's points are a little offcenter with where the lines are connecting and then in the middle of it starting from a point in the mid midway of the bottom line there's a triangle ,0,0,11:51,19,41,2,0:19,,,,,5,1,0,y
47,1,17,M,14:36,What alright so it's definitely one big square that contains just a triangle at the bottom of it and the tip of the triangle connects with the point on a line at the square ,0,0,14:56,20,34,0,0:20,,,,,2,3,1,y
48,1,17,M,11:04,So there's a square there's a square and within that is a triangle the square has dots at each of its corners and the triangle has dots at each of its corners ,0,0,11:20,16,32,0,0:16,,,,Points at figure,5,4,4,y

5,3,18,M,13:16,So I'm making a parallelogram that's kinda long and then um adjacent to it there's a triangle they share two dots ,0,0,13:30,14,21,1,0:14,,,,,1,1,0,y
6,3,18,M,11:26,So there's a triangle at the bottom with a dot at each end and then there's a parallelogram that connects to it with several dots with the two dots out here connecting it running along side of it,1,1,11:47,21,38,0,0:21,,,,Points to dots,2,2,2,y
11,3,18,M,11:39,So you have a parallelogram which is connected right at the top and you have it goes straight down to connect to these two and then it ends right here and it's connected right there and then you have a triangle coming off the side of the parallelogram and it looks like that,4,1,12:00,21,53,0,0:21,RP ,,,Points to figure,5,3,3,y
14,3,18,M,10:37,So there's a diamond but it's like really elongated and there's a trianglethat connects here and the rest of this I guess it's like a rectangle,1,1,10:50,13,26,0,0:13,RP,,,Pointing to figure ,3,2,3,y
16,3,18,M,12:59,Okay so this one is kind of like a rectangle and then it has a triangle coming off the side of iton the right and there's dots on it,0,0,13:21,22,29,0,0:22,,,,,3,3,2,y
22,3,18,M,13:11,Alrighty so there is a triangle here and then it's kind of connected to a parallelogram like so where as this is the parallelogram and that is the triangle ,2,1,13:33,22,29,1,0:22,,,,Points to figure,5,2,2,y
25,3,18,M,11:32,Okay there's what a parallelogram and then a triangle coming out of it and then there are dots um in the middle of the longest lines of the parallelogram and then on each side of the triangle ,0,0,11:57,25,37,1,0:25,,,,,3,1,2,y
26,3,18,M,14:27,It's a um a rectangle oh ok it's make it's a rectangle a sideways rectangle with four yeah four dots at each corner and a dot in the middle and a triangle that's connected with two dots ,0,0,14:53,26,37,4,0:26,,,,,0,0,0,y
37,3,18,M,11:01,So you have one I want to call it a rhombus um that's slanted and pretty big on the screen and the two points cuz there's two more halfway dots um one of those halfway dots connects to a corner piece to help make a triangle here on the side ,1,1,11:28,27,50,2,0:27,,,,Points to figure,2,2,3,y
45,3,18,M,8:14,Uh so this a parallelogram with a square er with uh a triangle next to it  ,0,0,8:28,14,16,3,0:14,,,,,3,5,3,y
51,3,18,M,8:51,It's a trinagle connected with a rhombus I think,0,0,9:06,15,9,0,0:15,,,,,2,2,2,y
54,3,18,M,15:23,Um so there's a parallelogram that's really long and on each tip there's um circles and then in the center of one of the lines there's a dot also and then off the cen off of the side of the parallelogram there's a triangle and at each tip there's also dots on that too ,0,0,15:53,30,54,3,0:30,,,,,3,3,0,y
55,3,18,M,11:09,It's an equilateral triangle with a long rhombus um kind of like resting on the slope of the triangle ,0,0,11:24,15,19,1,0:15,,,,,0,1,0,y
1,2,19,M,12:17,There's two triangles one has three points and another one has four  points one's a right triangle the three points on one side and another one makes that,1,1,12:34,17,28,0,0:17,,,,,1,3,0,y
10,2,19,M,12:47,There's a triangle shaped like that with circles on each corner and then another shaped like that next to it ,2,1,12:58,11,20,0,0:11,,,,,2,2,0,y
12,2,19,M,8:44,Um this one triangle with two points on that side and another triangle above it,1,1,8:58,14,15,1,0:14,,,,,5,1,1,y
13,2,19,M,9:00,So now there's a triangle like that there's a right triangle like this,2,1,9:08,8,13,0,0:08,,,,,5,3,0,y
17,2,19,M,15:34,Okay there is triangle and it's regualr and it's like a right triangle on the bottom with a dot at each side and a dot on the bottom one of the non hypotenuse sides ,0,0,15:50,16,34,0,0:16,,,,,5,4,3,y
20,2,19,M,12:04,There's two triangles and one corner has a triangle a period but the second one has one in the middle too,0,0,12:23,19,21,1,0:19,,,,,3,3,0,y

58,2,19,M,14:19,In this one there are three dots on the first triangle and then four dots on the second triangle ,0,0,14:48,29,19,0,0:29,,,,,1,1,0,y
5,3,20,M,14:48,I'm making a they look like just like three triangles and they're all connected with um by a dot at the center the bottom triangle is a skinnier triangle um it basically looks like a bow with a triangle at the bottom there's a total of seven dots ,0,0,15:14,26,48,4,0:26,,,,,5,1,1,y
6,3,20,M,12:49,So there's three triangles all three share a middle point but the other two triangles on the left and right and the last one on the bottom with points on all the ends ,0,0,13:03,14,33,0,0:14,,,,,2,1,0,y
11,3,20,M,13:09,So you have a dot in the middle and that has two triangles coming off of it  so they're all connected so this would be connected that would be connected and then you have another like skinnier triangle coming off the bottom which is all connected ,2,1,13:27,18,46,0,0:18,RP,,,Points to figure,5,4,4,y
14,3,20,M,11:50,So there's a triangle like that and then another triangle they both meet at the same point and then another below it that's a bit longer so and they all meet at this point,2,1,12:04,14,34,0,0:14,RP,,,pointing to figure,5,3,2,y
16,3,20,M,14:24,Okay so this one has a dot in the center and it has two triangles coming off of either side and then another triangle coming off on the bottom ,0,0,14:44,20,29,0,0:20,,,,,3,3,2,y
22,3,20,M,14:25,Alrighty there are three triangles all connected to each a dot in the center the triangles on the left and the right are symmetrical and then the triangle at the bottom is a little tinier with long lines and a smaller base,0,0,14:44,19,42,0,0:19,,,,Points to figure,5,3,2,y
25,3,20,M,13:09,Okay there's two triangles facing one antoher and then they meet at the top and then there's another triangle on the bottom that also meets the dot in the middle of all three triangles ,0,0,13:32,23,34,0,0:23,,,,,5,1,1,y
26,3,20,M,16:04,It's two triangles two sideways triangles that have two dots one that connects them and there's a triangle at the bottom that connects to the middle,0,0,16:16,12,26,1,0:12,,,,,4,3,3,y
35,3,20,M,14:52,Okay uh this shape is like three triangles and all of their points intersect um er they all meet at like an inner point and they have dots on each of their corners and they have they all meet at this one dot in the middle,0,0,15:12,20,46,3,0:20,,,,plays with dots,2,0,0,y
37,3,20,M,12:36,Um so you've got three triangles here they all connect at one certain point with one another um I'd almost describe it like an angel I guess spreading its wings a little bit um so you just have three triangles meeting in the middle here and then just the uh two sides well sides of the triangle coming out here,1,1,13:04,28,60,4,0:28,,,,Points to figure,5,4,3,y
45,3,20,M,9:16,Uh this is uh two triangles er three triangles touching on the middle and each have dots on their ends ,0,0,9:31,15,20,3,0:15,,,,,5,2,2,y
54,3,20,M,17:28,Um so there's three triangles going off of a center point um two of the triangles are identical and are reflecting each other then the bottom triangle has two really long sides and then a short um side and all the sides of the triangle has dots on each end er all the corners of the triangles have dots on each end ,0,0,17:54,26,62,4,0:26,,,,Points to figure,5,3,3,y
55,3,20,M,12:40,There are two equilateral triangles pointing into each other in the middle with an isosceles triangle pointing up into the vertex where those meet and there are dots on all vertices ,0,0,12:58,18,31,0,0:18,,,,,5,4,4,y
7,1,21,M,14:46,You have a equilateral triangle with um dots at each corner and below that you have a diamond like shape also with dots at each corner ,0,0,15:08,22,26,1,0:22,,,,,0,0,0,y
8,1,21,M,19:15,Um so there's a triangle facing pointed down um with dots at each corner and there's another parallelogram with four corners um that has a point at each corner um and its right underneath the triangle ,0,0,19:43,28,36,4,0:28,,,,,4,1,0,y
15,1,21,M,15:05,Okay so there's a triangle above and then a rectangle below that that is slanted,0,0,15:21,16,15,0,0:16,,,,,5,2,2,y
18,1,21,M,17:21,So we have a offset square here with points at each of the corners and then we have a triangle just above that with points at each of its corners ,1,1,17:36,15,30,0,0:15,,,,,5,3,2,y
19,1,21,M,17:19,There's a triangle on top with its point and below it a parallelogram like that,1,1,17:35,16,15,0,0:16,,,,Points to figure,3,2,1,y
23,1,21,M,15:55,Um there so there's a triangle that's faced downwards that's faced downwards on a diamond that's faced towards the right and at the top of this diamond there are two dots each corner the right and left corner there's a dot at the bottom left corner and there's a dot at the bottom right corner ,0,0,16:23,28,55,3,0:28,,,,Points to figure,4,1,0,y
24,1,21,M,18:33,Alright this one is a small triangle on the top of this and then those it has three dots on the ends and below it there's a square like this ,1,1,18:52,19,30,0,0:19,,,,Points to figure,4,3,3,y
28,1,21,M,12:31,It's a triangle dots on all corners and there's a parallelogram that has dots on all corners,0,0,12:40,9,17,0,0:09,,,,,4,2,0,y
31,1,21,M,12:40,There's one small triangle on top a dot at each corner and then a rhombus with a dot at each corner like that,1,1,12:54,14,23,0,0:14,,,,,4,4,4,y
32,1,21,M,10:35,So there is a small triangle up here with a little diamond down below it,1,1,10:42,7,15,0,0:07,,,,,5,1,1,y
33,1,21,M,14:06,There's a triangle on the top with dots on each corner and then um a rhombus on the bottom with dots on each corner,0,0,14:20,14,24,1,0:14,,,,,5,3,3,y
44,1,21,M,14:35,Uh on the top of this is a smaller triangle that is separate from a parallelogram on the bottom of it ,0,0,14:46,11,21,1,0:11,,,,,4,3,1,y
47,1,21,M,18:27,Okay so it's looking like this is just a triangle with points at the end and then I'm just gonna call it a parallelogram why not whatever a parallelogram that is not connected to them to the triangle but is kind of like off doing its thing and this side does that look like it yeah that kinda looks like it crap,2,1,18:58,31,62,1,0:31,,,,,4,5,4,y
48,1,21,M,13:33,So there's an upside down triangle with dots at each of its corners in the upper right and below it there's a diamond with dots at each of its corners ,0,0,13:47,14,30,0,0:14,,,,,4,2,1,y
52,1,21,M,18:45,Okay so we got a triangle up top with points on all three corners and then we have a slanty uh square on the bottom with points on all four corners they are not intersecting in any way ,0,0,19:12,27,38,1,0:27,,,,,3,2,0,y
56,1,21,M,29:23:00,Okay so there's a triangle at the top uh with a top point facing uh upside down uh there are points on each corner uh and lines that connect all the points to form a triangle and then under that there's a parallelogram with a point at each corner and uh lines that connect all of the points together ,0,0,29:55:00,32,59,5,0:32,,,,,2,1,1,y
60,1,21,M,15:55,So um there is a triangle with three points in it and a lopsided rectangle with with four points in every corner,0,0,16:19,24,22,2,0:24,,,,,2,2,0,y
5,3,22,M,16:19,So at the top there's a line a dot at each end and there are um two triangles connected with one dot at the center ,0,0,16:33,14,25,1,0:14,,,,,2,3,0,y
6,3,22,M,14:02,So there's one line above with two triangles beneath sharing a common point in the middle and then indirectly beneath the line above ,0,0,14:18,16,23,0,0:16,,,,,0,0,1,y
11,3,22,M,14:24,So you have a line right here and then below you have two dots that are connected and then you have a triangle that's connected to another triangle by a center  point and all the lines connect right here ,2,1,14:42,18,39,0,0:18,RP,,,Points to figure,4,4,1,y
14,3,22,M,12:48,So there's a line at top just connected by two points and then below it there's two triangles um so like that's one triangle oh they both meet at the same point sorry so that's one triangle and then that's the other ,2,1,13:06,18,42,2,0:18,RP,,,pointing to figure,1,2,0,y
16,3,22,M,15:50,Okay so this one's a straight line with two dots on either end and there's two triangles below it and they’re connected and they all have dots on the corners,0,0,16:12,22,30,0,0:22,,,,,2,0,0,y
22,3,22,M,15:37,Alrighty so you have a line with two dots at the end points and then you have a dot that connects to triangles and these triangles are symmetrical the line is not connected to the triangles ,0,0,15:54,17,36,0,0:17,,,,Point to figure,5,2,1,y
25,3,22,M,14:32,Okay there's just a line on the top with dots on each end and then on the bottom there are two triangles connected by a small dot in the middle and then dots on each angle ,0,0,14:50,18,36,0,0:18,,,,,3,4,3,y
26,3,22,M,17:30,So a line at the top um and a dot at each end and there's two triangles at the bottom with um wait a dot at each corner with one dot that connects both ,0,0,17:53,23,34,2,0:23,,,,,2,1,0,y
35,3,22,M,16:17,Ah this is like it's a line with dots on each end and then right underneath it is two triangles that are connected uh at one of their points and have dots on each of their points,0,0,16:36,19,37,2,0:19,,,,,2,2,0,y
37,3,22,M,14:03,Alright so you just got one non connected line above both these triangles that I'm about to make here um and you've got the corner piece of the triangles here and then on the bottom dot that represents a corner the triangles connect but the line above is just its own thing ,1,1,14:23,20,52,1,0:20,,,,,2,2,3,y
45,3,22,M,10:17,There's a line on top with two triangles touching on the bottom ,0,0,10:28,11,12,0,0:11,,,,,2,2,1,y
51,3,22,M,10:55,One line by two triangles ,0,0,11:03,8,5,0,0:08,,,,,3,4,3,y
54,3,22,M,19:04,Um there's a line on top and at each end of the line there's um dots and then below the line there's two triangles that are exactly the same and they are connected by one dot at the corner and they also have dots at each corner,0,0,19:28,24,47,2,0:24,,,,,4,2,2,y
55,3,22,M,13:46,There's a line on the top with dots on either end and two equilateral triangles sitting next to each other below it pointing up ,0,0,13:56,10,24,0,0:10,,,,,0,1,0,y
7,1,23,M,16:16,You have a triangle with a long side and two shorter sides of equal length of all that triangle you have a trapezoid with dots at every corner ,0,0,16:37,21,28,0,0:21,,,,,4,2,1,y
8,1,23,M,21:19,Um so there's a triangle pointed down with dots at each corner um and then there is a trapezoid with dots on dots on the triangle and then there's a dot at each corner and it's also facing down ,0,0,21:42,23,39,3,0:23,,,,,5,3,2,y
15,1,23,M,16:36,So a triangle above and then um four sided shape connected with their smaller line on the bottom and the long line on the top,0,0,16:50,14,25,1,0:14,,,,,5,3,3,y
18,1,23,M,19:01,Alright we have another triangle with points like that and then we have below it we have a four pointed trapezoid with a line segment here point and two points here ,3,1,19:19,18,31,1,0:18,,,,Reference to figure without description (no pointing though),5,4,4,y
19,1,23,M,18:49,Okay there's a triangle on top and below it is a trapezoid,0,0,19:01,12,12,0,0:12,,,,,3,1,1,y
23,1,23,M,17:30,So there's a triangle that's faced that's faced downwards on top of a what is that um we'll just say on top of half of a stop sign and um there's a dot there's two dots on the right side and the left side and then the bottom of half of a stop sign that's what the shape is it goes down and it's connected by two other dots on a line ,0,0,18:00,30,72,5,0:30,,,,Points to figure,2,3,0,y
24,1,23,M,20:18,Alright this one there's a triangle that's on the top like this with three dots at the ends and then at the bottom there's a shape with a long line at the top and then a small line up here and they all connect below it,2,1,20:38,20,46,0,0:20,,,,,3,1,1,y

5,3,1,NG,0:33,So there are two shapes on the the left side on my left side I see three like um a triangle with a central dot facing the right and there's another one that's like a trapezoid with four dots,0,0,0:53,20,39,3,0:20,,,,,1,1,0,y
6,3,1,NG,0:25,Alright so there's two triangles well one triangle and then another uh parallelogram with dots on each of the sides of the triangle on the left and the other one is on the right ,0,0,0:39,14,34,1,0:14,,,,,4,1,0,y
8,1,1,G,0:14,Okay so there's two shapes there's a triangle on the left side umt here's three points with three dots at each points and there's kinda like a diamondish figure that um has four sides and then a dot as each point and they're side by side ,0,0,0:36,22,46,2,0:22,RI triangle; BI points; RI diamond; RI dot at each point,4,,,3,2,0,y
9,1,1,G,0:18,So there's a triangle and then sort of a um almost a parallelogram not quite um there's a point at each of the corners of the two figures and they're next to each other ,0,0,0:29,11,34,2,0:11,BI triangle; RI point; BB next,2,1,,3,1,0,y
14,3,1,NG,0:10,So there's there's a right triangle well I guess it's an isosceles so um it's sort of at an angle and next to it there's a square that's also sort of tilted at an angle so but there it's a square and a triangle but they look different cuz they're tilted ,0,0,0:30,20,51,2,0:20,,,,,0,0,0,y
15,1,1,G,0:17,So there's two triangles er one triangle and one like diamond shape um dots top and bottom connectin gto a dot in the middle and then for the diamond two dots top and bottom and then middle dots not connected  ,0,0,0:36,19,40,2,0:19,LI triangles; Li dots,2,,,2,1,0,y
